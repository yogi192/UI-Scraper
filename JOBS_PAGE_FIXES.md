# Jobs Page Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. ✅ Timezone Issues
- Updated `formatDate()` function to handle UTC timestamps properly
- Timestamps from the backend (in UTC) are now correctly converted to local system time
- Applied to both the Jobs list page and Job detail page

### 2. ✅ View Button with Live Preview Modal
- **View button now opens a modal** instead of navigating to a separate page
- Modal shows:
  - Real-time job status and progress bar
  - Job parameters
  - **Live output/logs** in a terminal-style view
  - Completed results or error messages
- Modal auto-refreshes every 2 seconds for running jobs
- Cancel button available within the modal

### 3. ✅ Progress Bar Implementation
- Added visual progress bar showing "X of Y tasks completed"
- Progress bar appears for running jobs with step tracking
- Shows progress message alongside the progress bar
- Progress is visible in:
  - Jobs list table
  - Job preview modal
  - Job detail page (if accessed directly)

### 4. ✅ Live Logs Feature
- Jobs now capture execution logs with timestamps
- Logs displayed in a terminal-style console view
- Auto-scrolls to show latest output
- Shows "Waiting for output..." when no logs yet

### 5. ✅ Backend Updates
- Updated JobModel to include:
  - `current_step`: Current task number
  - `total_steps`: Total number of tasks
  - `progress_message`: Current task description
  - `logs`: Array of timestamped log entries
- Job runner now:
  - Updates progress in real-time
  - Captures logs for each step
  - Simulates progress for demo purposes

## How Progress Tracking Works:

When a job is running, the backend updates progress like this:
```python
await update_job_progress(job_id, current_step=3, total_steps=10, message="Scraping page 3...")
```

This shows up in the UI as:
- A visual progress bar (30% complete in this example)
- Text: "3 of 10 tasks • Scraping page 3..."

## Testing:
1. Create a new job from the Jobs page
2. The job will show progress updates in real-time
3. Click "View" to see detailed progress on the job detail page
4. Use "Cancel" to stop pending or running jobs
