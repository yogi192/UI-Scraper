# GitHub Upload Instructions

Your UI-Scraper project is ready to be uploaded to GitHub. Follow these steps:

## 1. Authenticate with GitHub CLI

Run this command and follow the interactive prompts:
```bash
gh auth login
```

Choose:
- GitHub.com
- HTTPS
- Login with a web browser (or paste an authentication token)

## 2. Create and Push Repository

Once authenticated, run:
```bash
gh repo create UI-Scraper --public --description "AI-powered web scraping and data extraction tool with full-stack web interface" --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Alternative: Manual Creation

If you prefer to create the repository manually:

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository named "UI-Scraper"
3. Make it public
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Run these commands (replace YOUR_USERNAME):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/UI-Scraper.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
